I'd like to say it's to always maintain a good work attitude, and complete tasks that your bosses and coaches ask you to do happily but don't hesitate to speak up if you are unhappy about something, are confused or need more information, effective communication is a key to resolving issues, and don't forget listen to your parent/guardian’s advice. 
I’ve always had a good memory for details, which really helps me in my daily tasks. My team and my parents have worked with me to establish a regular routine for each task, which makes it easier for me to follow through consistently.This repetition helped me learn and remember each part of the process. Also, Technology has simplified many aspects of running my business. Tools like Siri on the iPhone help me stay organized, set reminders for tasks. Facetime also helps me stay in touch with my team and my parents, allowing me to get real-time help and support when I need it.
A workplace where everyone is friendly and patient really makes a big impact. It's important to me that my coworkers support each other because it creates a team where everyone can thrive together.

I'm motivated by the desire to do my job better and to show my coworkers and friends that I can handle more responsibilities. Also, learning new skills makes me feel proud and capable. It's also a great way to increase my earnings!

I contribute to my team by being supportive and maintaining a positive atmosphere in the workplace. My role involves not only handling specific tasks efficiently but also uplifting my colleagues through words of encouragement and good natured teasing. To further enhance my contributions, I am open to learning and taking on new tasks, which allows me to expand my role and support our team’s goals more broadly.
